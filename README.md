- 👋 Hi, I’m @DoubleTrio
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile and game development with Flutter/C#/Unity/React Native
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and how to apply CI/CD into my development style
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Flutter projects or learn web development
- 📫 You can reach me through lakacey03@gmail.com, at my Twitter @TheKaceFiles, or my Discord #Trio-4442!

My "main" projects includes a private Typescript Discord bot which plays various minigames and a educational political cartoon and image app called Hawktoons (which I am currently working on)
